                <h2>Lifi</h2>
                <p>This project aims at designing and implementing a 
                    prototype model for text transmission through LI-FI 
                    technology. This model will transmit and receive text 
                    data using light as a carrier.To achieve this goal, we would be mainly using Arduino 
                    uno microcontroller, LED sources and photodiode for 
                    transmitting and receiving data respectively.
                    The main objective of this project will be to provide a 
                    high speed data transmission using visible spectrum of 
                    light in day-to-day life achieving more efficient and cost 
                    effective network. Through LI-FI based transmission, 
                    revolution in telecommunication industry can be brought 
                    and hence providing internet access to remote areas.

                    DEEP LEARNING</h2>
                <p>Detecting scuffles in video footage is crucial for security and crowd management. This thesis aims to develop automated systems using computer vision and machine learning to swiftly identify instances of violence or conflict. Challenges include real-world complexities like occlusions and varying lighting conditions. Previous research has explored techniques such as motion analysis and deep learning, but significant hurdles remain. Our approach combines insights from various methods to develop robust algorithms for scuffle detection. The goal is to improve situational awareness and enable proactive intervention in diverse scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Quality Prediction Using ML</h2>
                <p>This presentation report explores the application of machine learning techniques 
                    in two distinct domains: Apple product quality prediction and web page phishing 
                    detection. In the realm of product quality prediction, we employ machine learning 
                    algorithms to analyse historical data related to Apple products, including 
                    manufacturing defects, customer complaints, and warranty claims. By leveraging 
                    this data, our model aims to forecast potential quality issues and enable proactive 
                    measures to improve product reliability and customer satisfaction.</p>
